I was born and grown in Anqing, Anhui Province, China (ÂÆâÂæΩÁúÅÂÆâÂ∫ÜÂ∏Ç). Now, I am a PhD candidate in the [NIEER, CAS](https://nieer.cas.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Wei Liu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~lliuwei). I received the bachelor's Degree (2018-2022) and master's Degree (2022-2025) from the [School of Land Engineering](https://sle.chd.edu.cn/), Chang'an University,China.

Currently, my research interests focus on the interplay among **Environment**, **Geography** and **Machine learning**, which can be described as:
- **Multidisciplinary Research at the Nexus of Environment, Geography, and Machine Learning.** My research lies at the intersection of environmental science, geographical analysis, and machine learning. I employ advanced machine learning techniques such as BPNN and SHAP to improve the predictive accuracy and understanding of environmental phenomena, particularly focusing on CO‚ÇÇ emissions and air pollution.
- **Geographical Analysis for Sustainable Environmental Management.** My future work will involve leveraging geographical data to analyze land use patterns and their implications for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This geographic-environmental integration helps in crafting strategies for sustainable land management and addressing key environmental challenges.
- **Machine Learning in Environmental Impact Assessment.** I explore the application of machine learning in evaluating environmental impacts, with a particular emphasis on CO‚ÇÇ emissions. By combining these approaches, I aim to provide data-driven insights that inform and enhance sustainability efforts on both regional and global scales.
